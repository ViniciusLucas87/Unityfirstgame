# Unityfirstgame
This is my first experience with Unity and C# Code
I know that you will find a lot of errors and bad coding in my game. I am newbie and have a long way to thrive. However, I am doing my best to learn fast
Feel free to use this code as you wish, I also open to all your feedbacks!
Thanks enjoy!
